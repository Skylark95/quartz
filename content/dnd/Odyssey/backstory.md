Pyrrhos - This name means "fiery" or "red-haired," which could be fitting for a wizard character known for their mastery of fire magic.

Pyrrhos was diligent student of the Academy in Mytros who studied magic for decades who later went on to be a teacher at the academy. The first son of a powerful family with godly lineage, Pyrrhos lived a very comfortable and happy life. He was very well respected for his intellect among his peers at the academy and was destined to become the next ruler of Mytros.

Then one day returning home after a long time spent in his studies at the Academy to his wife and child, everything changed. He came home to nothing. His wife and child gone, house dark and void of all furnishings. Pyrrhos panicked and asked his neighbors and peers at the Academy about what happend, but none of them know, so much so as if his family had never existed.

On the brink of insanity, he quit teaching and now spends almost all his time determined to find an explanation buried in the books at the Academy.

He has been called from the Academy to the Temple of the Oracle to assist in preventing the doom of Thylea, and as a part of saving the world, will learn answers of his family's disappearance.
