Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This flat, gray-and-black river stone is inscribed with an unknown arcane symbol and feels cool to the touch. While carrying the stone, you can gain advantage on one ability check of your choice. The stone canâ€™t be used this way again until the next dawn.
