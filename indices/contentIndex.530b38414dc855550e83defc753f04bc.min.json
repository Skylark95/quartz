It knows every anguage you know while attuned to it.\n\nPersonality. Imbued with the lifeforce of an ancient celestial, Oathbinder is the sworn enemy of fiends and other evil extraplanar creatures. It speaks only when it has something important to say, and can often be openly curt and matter-of-fact when doing so. Oathbinder is courageous in the face of all that is evil. If its wielder actively chooses to flee from facing an extraplanar evil, such as a demon or powerful undead, and can't provide good justification for doing so, the weapon openly mocks them for their cowardice until the wielder can redeem themselves by defeating a worthy evil opponent. A protector of life and light, Oathbinder has no patience for those who perform acts spurned by dishonesty and corruption. It strongly protests against any wielder who continuously participates in such actions, and can be very disagreeable when its wielder consistently tolerates others who do the same.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T23:54:16.413358277Z","tags":["dnd","Chult Campaign","Magic Items"]},"/dnd/Chult/Magic-Items/Obolaka-Spirit-Ring-of-Protection":{"title":"Obo'laka Spirit / Ring of Protection","content":"Obo'laka\r\n(pronounced oh-boh-LAH-kah)\r\nObo'laka, the Zorbo, is nervous and obsessive.\r\n\r\nFlaw\r\nWhile inhabited by Obo'laka, you gain the following flaw, which overrides any opposing flaw: \"I am risk-averse and a slave to routine.\"\r\n\r\nPower\r\nWhile Obo'laka inhabits you, you can attune to one additional magic item.
