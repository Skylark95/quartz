Alright, so Reggie has left his tribe to prove himself. But he finds himself hunting and ranging alone, boars and deer not really providing much in the glory department. So you start going from town to town looking for adventure. You meet Swarley after walking into town one morning. He greets you while he continues to unload a caravan of supplies. Seeing your strong frame, he offers you a free meal if you help him out. After chatting with you a bit during the work he realizes how valuable you could be to the town and asks you to do some odd jobs for him (clear the giant rats out of the cellar, track down and return his neighbors prize boar that escaped into the woods, low level adventurer stuff). He knows that you are looking for something greater, but he pays you in room and board, a little cash on the side, and you find it hard not to like the guy. You know that your destiny lies elsewhere, but you have a hard time saying no when he asks you to do a job for him.
